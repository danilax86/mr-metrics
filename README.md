# GitLab merged requests metrics table

A simple web application that shows a [developer Ã— repository] table of merged MRs.

# Roadmap

Logic:

- [ ] Make issuing GitLab requests via cron, not by "/" endpoint
- [ ] When requesting "/" endpoint, get data directly from database without making requests to GitLab
- [ ] Write script for applying migrations

For contributors:

- [ ] Create a nice README
    - [ ] How to set up
    - [ ] How to run
    - [ ] How to contribute
    - [x] Roadmap
- [ ] Add a license (at the top of each file perhaps?)
- [ ] Add Dockerfile for local development
- [ ] Add Devcontainer support (we live in a modern era, c'mon)
- [ ] Add labels for issues

For code quality:

- [ ] Setup linters
- [ ] Add basic GitHub actions for CI/CD (only in pull requests)
    - [ ] Build
    - [ ] Test
    - [ ] Lint
- [ ] Bot, that advices to bump versions of dependencies
- [ ] Disable merging by people, only by bot that applies checks before merging just in time
